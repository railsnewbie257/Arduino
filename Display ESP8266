This is an excellent display. I soldered a header on, then plugged the display into a breadboard connected to an Arduino Uno, and it lit right up. Contrast is adjustable as others have described. Although I am no expert on these things, the connections to the display seem to be the same as the numerous on-line examples which I found. If you are having trouble getting this display working, then I recommend you look on-line for sample code and wiring instructions and have some fun with it.

PostNote: Thought I would improve the value of this review for beginners by giving a pin listing, since none is provided by the seller:
(Disclaimer: I found this online, and it worked for me. You should check for yourself!)

Pin # Function
1 VSS (Gnd)
2 VDD (+5V)
3 Contrast Adjustment - Connect the center tap of a 10k pot connected between Gnd and 5V
4 RS Register Select Input
5 R/W Read/Write Signal, normally at Gnd
6 E Enable
7 DB0
8 DB1
9 DB2
10 DB3
11 DB4
12 DB5
13 DB6
14 DB7
15 LED (+) (+5V through a current limiting resistor - I used 220ohm)
16 LED (-) Gnd

The Arduino connections are as follows:
LCD Pin: Arduino Pin:
RS D12
E D11
DB4 D5
DB5 D4
DB6 D3
DB7 D2

There are two key lines that should be included in your Arduino sketch:

#include <LiquidCrystal.h> //Makes available the Arduino environment Liquid Crystal Display
Liquid Crystal lcd(12,11,5,4,3,2); //Assigns the proper pin connections (as above) between Arduino and the display
